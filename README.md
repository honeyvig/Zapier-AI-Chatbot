# Zapier-AI-Chatbot
Build and deploy an AI chatbot using Zapier.
Ensure integration with our website, including assistance in customising the appearance of the chatbot button.
CRM Integration (Monday.com):

Link the chatbot to our Monday.com CRM so that chat records are automatically saved to relevant customer records.
Shopify Inventory Integration:

Connect the chatbot to our Shopify inventory board to ensure real-time updates.
The chatbot must recognise when items are sold or added to the inventory and adjust responses accordingly.
Inline Calculator Functionality:

Integrate the chatbot with our website’s budget calculator to enable it to perform calculations directly within conversations.
Ensure the chatbot can guide users through budget-related queries and dynamically calculate costs based on their input.
Knowledge Base Content:

Guide us on what content needs to be added to optimise the chatbot’s functionality.
Use the provided content and potentially expand the knowledge base to suit chatbot needs.
Branding:

Ensure the chatbot and all interfaces are fully branded to align with our identity.
Calendly Integration:

Integrate the chatbot with Calendly, allowing users to schedule calls with our team seamlessly.
Logic & Directives:

Build the logic framework for the chatbot to handle enquiries intelligently, including narrowing down responses based on customer needs (e.g., inventory filtering).
Create chatbot directives (instruction sets) for handling conversations, excluding irrelevant questions, and escalating specific queries.
Inventory Filtering:

Develop a framework to dynamically filter and refine inventory results.
Ensure the chatbot avoids overwhelming users by showing only the most relevant options based on specific criteria (e.g., price range, features).
Trigger-Based Actions:

Set up triggers for actionable requests (e.g., "Can I reserve a property now?") to provide appropriate forms or links (e.g., a reservation form or Stripe payment link).
===================
To build the AI-powered model for grading refurbished electronics based on their condition, we will follow a series of steps, including gathering a dataset, pre-processing the data, designing a machine learning model, and deploying it as part of an app or API. Below is an outline of the Python code to get started with the AI model for grading electronics.
Steps for Building the AI-Powered Grading Model

    Data Collection and Preprocessing:
        Gather a large dataset of images for different types of electronics (e.g., smartphones, laptops, tablets) that have been graded into different categories such as "Fair", "Good", "Very Good", "Excellent", and "New".
        Annotate the images with the correct grade labels and use the images to train the model.

    Building the AI Model:
        We'll use a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification, leveraging deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

    Training the Model:
        We'll preprocess the images, normalize them, and then train the CNN model.

    Integration with a User Interface:
        The trained model can be integrated into a web or mobile app for easy use.

Below is the Python code using TensorFlow to create and train an image classification model.
1. Setup and Data Preparation

import os
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16

# Set up image directories for each class (Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent, New)
data_dir = "path_to_dataset"

# Use ImageDataGenerator to load and preprocess images
datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=0.2)

train_data = datagen.flow_from_directory(data_dir, 
                                         target_size=(224, 224),
                                         batch_size=32,
                                         class_mode='categorical',
                                         subset='training')

val_data = datagen.flow_from_directory(data_dir,
                                       target_size=(224, 224),
                                       batch_size=32,
                                       class_mode='categorical',
                                       subset='validation')

2. Building the AI Model

Here we use a CNN-based architecture, with VGG16 pre-trained for feature extraction and additional layers to fine-tune it for our specific problem.

# Define the model architecture using VGG16 for transfer learning
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the base model to avoid updating pre-trained weights during training
base_model.trainable = False

# Define the custom model
model = Sequential([
    base_model,
    Flatten(),
    Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(5, activation='softmax')  # 5 classes: Fair, Good, Very Good, Excellent, New
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', 
              loss='categorical_crossentropy', 
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Summary of the model
model.summary()

3. Training the Model

Now, we train the model using the prepared dataset.

# Train the model with the training and validation data
history = model.fit(train_data, epochs=10, validation_data=val_data)

4. Evaluate the Model

After training, evaluate the model's accuracy on the validation set.

# Evaluate the model on validation data
val_loss, val_accuracy = model.evaluate(val_data)
print(f"Validation Accuracy: {val_accuracy * 100:.2f}%")

5. Saving and Exporting the Model

Once the model is trained and evaluated, save it to use in the production environment (e.g., a web or mobile app).

# Save the model
model.save('electronics_grading_model.h5')

6. Inference and Prediction

Once the model is trained and saved, you can load it for making predictions on new images.

# Load the saved model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('electronics_grading_model.h5')

# Function to predict the grade of an image
def predict_grade(image_path):
    img = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.load_img(image_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = tf.keras.preprocessing.image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    class_names = ['Fair', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent', 'New']
    predicted_class = class_names[np.argmax(predictions)]

    return predicted_class

# Test the model with a new image
image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"
grade = predict_grade(image_path)
print(f"The grade for the given product is: {grade}")

7. Integration with Web/Mobile App

Once the model is trained and tested, you can integrate it with an app or website. Here’s a simple outline for API integration using Flask (for web deployment):

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image

# Load the model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model('electronics_grading_model.h5')

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define API endpoint for predictions
@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get the image from the POST request
    img_file = request.files['image']
    img_path = './uploads/' + img_file.filename
    img_file.save(img_path)

    # Preprocess the image
    img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))
    img_array = image.img_to_array(img) / 255.0
    img_array = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis=0)

    # Predict the grade
    predictions = model.predict(img_array)
    class_names = ['Fair', 'Good', 'Very Good', 'Excellent', 'New']
    predicted_class = class_names[np.argmax(predictions)]

    return jsonify({'grade': predicted_class})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This creates a web service that can be used to predict the grade of any image of electronics. The client can send an image via POST request, and the server will return the predicted grade.
Conclusion

In this solution:

    TensorFlow was used to build a deep learning model for classifying the condition of electronics based on images.
    The model is built using a VGG16 architecture with transfer learning.
    A simple Flask API was demonstrated for real-time inference in web applications.
    This AI model can be integrated into your platform, automating the grading of refurbished electronics.

Next steps would include gathering a sufficiently large and diverse dataset, improving the model’s accuracy, and deploying it to production. You can also extend the model by fine-tuning it or using other models like ResNet or InceptionV3 depending on performance.
